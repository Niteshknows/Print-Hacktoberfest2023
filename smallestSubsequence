# Python3 program for the above approach

# Function to find the lexicographically
# smallest subsequence of length N-1
def firstSubsequence(s):

	allsubseq = []

	k = []

	# Generate all subsequence of
	# length N-1
	for i in range(len(s)):

		# Store main value of string str
		k = [i for i in s]

		# Erasing element at position i
		del k[i]
		allsubseq.append("".join(k))

	# Sort the vector
	allsubseq = sorted(allsubseq)

	# Print first element of vector
	print(allsubseq[0])

# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
	
	# Given string S
	S = "geeksforgeeks"

	# Function Call
	firstSubsequence(S)
